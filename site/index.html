<h1>Python/Selenium/Test Driven Development</h1>
<p>This walkthrough is going to cover using Selenium in a test drivent 
development paradigm to develop a simple CRUD web application. Briefly Test
Driven Development is the practise of writing simple tests first and then
writing the code to fulfill those tests. This is generally a well understood
paradigm for low level library code. Frameworks like JUnit for Java and 
unittest for Python make TDD for low level library reasonably straight forward
and it's the rare programmer that doesn't appreciate the value of good unit 
tests. Integration testing is generally the same as unit testing but instead of
mocking out dependencies the code is actually making external calls to 
dependant systems. One example of unit vs integration testing would be tests
for your code that saves data to a database. A unit test will not access the
database - any calls that would go to the database are typically mocked out 
with implemenations. An integration test typically will have real calls out to
the database and the database state will be verified as part of the test 
assertions.</p>
<p>In the case of web applications a significant chunk of the application will be
baked into UI of the application - ie what pages are in the application, the
HTML, CSS and Javascript on those pages, and how those pages cause the browser
to interact with the application server - ie what ajax calls, form submissions
and static or dynamic resources are loaded on each page. With Selenium it is 
possible to write tests for this interface and we can apply the TDD paradigm 
to grow our tests with our application. This tutorial will walk through this 
process for a simple CRUD application. While the application we will be testing
is fairly simple in it's scope and data the techniques described will for the
most part translate to large and more complex applications. I will include a 
section on some of the challenges of applying this approach to larger
applications and consider some ways of mitigating those problems. </p>
<h3>Our CRUD Application in Brief</h3>
<p>The application we will be writing tests for will be a simple address book. 
The addressbook will have entities consisting of Contacts and Addresses. Each
contact may be associated with zero to many addresses. A Contact has the
properties first name, last name and birthday. An address will consist of a
street address, street name, city, state and zipcode. </p>
<p>The CRUD application will be developed in parallel with the test suite which
is in keeping with TDD. First a test will be writen to verify some piece of
functionality and initially this test will fail. Then the functionality will
be added to the application to make the test pass and if necessary the test 
code will be adjusted to meet the actual implementation of the code under test.</p>
<p>Since the primary focus of this tutorial is how to apply TDD to the writing of
selenium tests I will not be focusing on the actual implementation of the CRUD
application. Only enough detail to describe the tests requirements and whatever
additional info is useful to someone following allong will be included. The web
is lousy with tutorials to create an address book. This tutorial will focus on
creating the tests.</p>
<p>TBD include some links to CRUD tutorials.</p>
<p>The application will use HTML5, Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery for it's front end
components and knowledge of those tools will be necessary to implement the 
tests correctly.</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping the Test Code</h3>
<p>A selenium test suite is basically an application unto itself. Granted it's 
goals are to test some other application but so much design and coding goes 
into good selenium test suite that it really is it's own application. I've 
found the best way to write reliable python application is using virtualenv to
setup a stable environment for the application code. Virtualenv allows you to
isolate the application code from the system that it's running on by. </p>
<p>So the first step of setting up our test suite is bootstrapping an empty 
envirnment virtual env. Here is a good reference of setting up a Flask 
application with virtual env http://www.enigmeta.com/2012/08/16/starting-flask/ 
Everything up to "Install Flask" is relevant to general virtualenv development.</p>
<p>First in a terminal cd to whichever directory you want to create your project 
in. There will be a new sub-directory containing the actual project. We will 
call our project PythonSeleniumHowTo and I want to keep the code in 
/home/myusername/myworkspace so I would run...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> /home/yourusername/yourworkspace
$ virtualenv PythonSeleniumHowTo
</pre></div>


<p>At this point you have an empty project that should look like this</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> PythonSeleniumHowTo
$ ls
bin include lib <span class="nb">local</span> pip-selfcheck.json
</pre></div>


<p>Most of the contents of the project at this point aren't relevant to us. The 
most important one is the bin/activate script. Whenever you are working on the
project from now on the first thing you should do is execute the following...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> PythonSeleniumHowTo
$ <span class="nb">source</span> bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>PythonSeleniumHowTo<span class="o">)</span> $
</pre></div>


<p>Your prompt will have changed to show the project name as a prefix to your
exiting prompt. This lets you know that you are running in a virutal env and
any changes you make to the python system will only apply within the context
of the virtualenv. So any new packages you add via <code>pip</code> will be visible in
the virtual env and no the running system. Likewise any changes in the parent
system won't effect the virtual env. To exit the virtualenv you just enter the
<code>deactivate</code> command.</p>
<p>At this point we're ready to write a failing test.</p>
<h3>The First Test Case (kind of)</h3>
<p>First create a directory named <code>tests</code>. This is where all the test code will 
live. In this directory create a file <code>test_address_index.py</code> and using your
favorite editor enter the following code...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unittest</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddressesIndexTestCase</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestCase</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_index_loads</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertTrue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you are sharp of eye you'll notice that we are assertTrue(False) so this 
test couldn't possibly pass. This is fine because right now we're just trying
to verify that we can run tests and that we have all the required modules 
available. Now try running the following.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>(PythonSeleniumHowTo) $ python test/test_address_index.py
F

<p>While the test fails we can see that it does actually run. Now at the top of 
the test/test_address_index.py file add the following import...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">selenium</span>

<p>Save the file and rerun the test command...</p>

<p>Now this isn't a test failure but rather an execution error. To fix it we need
to install the selenium module. From the cli run...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>(PythonSeleniumHowTo) $ pip install selenium

<p>As long as it installs successfully and it's selenium 2.x things should be 
okay. Lets try running the test again...</p>

</pre></div>


<p>Yay, this is the same failure as above so we've successfully installed the 
selenium module. Whenever I add a new module I like to make sure I update
the requirements text file with the following command...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>(PythonSeleniumHowTo) $ pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</pre></div>


<p>Make sure you include the requirements.txt file in your version control 
because it's what virtualenv and pip can use to recreate the execution 
environment. This WILL save you a headache later. Otherwise at some point
some random module will change and your test code will break for no good 
reason. Not fun.</p>
<p>Okay so now we've got a bogus test and a way to run it - let's see if we can 
make it less bogus.</p>
<h1>Some Kind of a Test</h1>
<p>Probaby the simpleist piece of functionality in any CRUD application is the 
"R" - retrieve. This is analogous to a SELECT in SQL. Since that is the 
easiest to implement and I want to make sure I have something to demo at the 
end of the sprint that's what I'll do first. Before that though I'll write a 
test. The test explicitly defines what should happen. In this case I will
arbitrarily say that this test will load up the root url of the application
under test, extract the list addresses from the page and verify the contents
of that list of addresses. Breaking it down further what is the simplist thing
I could possibly test for? Probaby the presence of the addresses ie that there
is a list of addresses on the page. Since this is very early in development I'm
free to define the HTML structure so I'll write the test to look for
<i>div.addresses &gt; div</i>, and verify that list isn't empty. Let's update the
test/test_address_index.py to the following...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">selenium.webdriver</span>

<p>Now when we run the test we see the following...</p>

.

<h3>Video Demo of Progress</h3>
<p>Below is a video demonstration of the test in action as things stand now.</p>

<h3>Moving On</h3>
<p>We're in a pretty good place now to start writing the test for the next 
incremental feature. Since we can see the list addresses probably the next 
easiest feature is a link to a form to add a new address. I'll go ahead and
define this feature simply as a link to /add relative to the application
root. The test for this will just check for the link, click the link and check
that the new edit page loads. Notice this will not check anything on the edit 
page itself - simply that the page loads. This will keep the test short and 
sweet. Keeping the tests short is an advantage in a few ways. First: when a test 
breaks it will be relatively easy to diagnose. The longer a test is the harder
it is to diagnose the problem and the more brittle it is. The second reason to
keep the tests short is speed. By speed I mean both processor time and 
programmer time. A lot of short tests can be parallelized to run the total 
suite more easily than one long serialized test and a set of small tests is
generally going to make your development loop for the programmer much faster.
That said lets get on with it.</p>
<p>Go ahead and add a new test method to add our new test to. Let's call it
test_index_add_link. We'll add it to the class like so...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">AddressesIndexTestCase</span>(<span class="n">unittest</span>.<span class="n">TestCase</span>):

<p>Astute readers will notice a couple of differences with our previous code 
besides the new test method. Now the setUp method actually opens the index page
and checks if it's open. Also we're now checking the page title as well as the 
current url to verify the page is open. This is a quirk of the selenium 
implementation where it reports the URL that the browser currently show. 
However depending on the platform running your web application the actual page
loaded may not be the one you want. If for example there was some server side 
error the browser would show the correct URL but the page would actually have a
500 error message in it. This makes it necessary to check some content of the
loaded page to verify we aren't seeing an error page. In our case I'll check 
the page title as that should only appear if we are on the correct page.</p>
<p>If we run this now we'll see the following...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>(PythonSeleniumHowTo) $ python test/test_address_index.py

<p>We can even run this test and it will pass because the URLs already exist. 
Before we get to the real test code though it's worth setting up a mechanism to
run all of our tests at once. It's generally a good idea to be able to easily
run both a single test and the full test suite. We can easily do the first 
already but we lack a way to run all the tests. This can be achieved with a 
test suite. First add the following function definition to the 
test_address_index.py file...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def suite():
  suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(AddressesIndexTestCase)
  return suite
</pre></div>


<p>Now create a new file test/test_all.py and add the following code...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unittest</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">test_address_index</span>

<span class="n">allTests</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestSuite</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">allTests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addTest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_address_index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">suite</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TextTestRunner</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">allTests</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you run this you should see the following...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>(PythonSeleniumHowTo) $ python test/test_all.py 
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 4.582s

OK

</pre></div>


<p>Add a similar suite function to the test_address_add.py file and then add it 
to the full suite the same way we added the test_addres_index case. Now 
executing the test/test_all.py code should run all of the tests. Whenever we 
add a new test case we simply add it to the test_all.py file and we have a 
convenient way to run the full suite. Now let's get back to the add address 
test. </p>
<p>The requirements for the add address page are as follows...
<em> It must have a form that takes the properties of an address
</em> A submit button to submit the form
* On successfull submission the form should redirect back to the address index</p>
<p>So the first thing we need is a form we can fill out. Before we create that 
form we should create a test that fails without it. The most basic thing I
can do with a form is enter some text into a text field so let's go ahead and
do that by adding...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>self.driver.find_element_by_id(&quot;address-street&quot;).send_keys(&quot;285 Edgewater Ln&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>... to the test_address_add method. Now this should fail spectacularly because 
that element doesn't exist on the page. Now let's submit the form - oh wait -
test first. Add the following to the test code</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>self.driver.find_element_by_id(&quot;address-submit&quot;).click()
</pre></div>


<p>Once again a spectacular failure. Go ahead and add the button to the form. At
this point we expect to be back on the index page of addresses so let's add
a check for that...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>self.assertTrue(&quot;http://localhost:8080/addressbook&quot;, self.driver.current_url)
</pre></div>


<p>Presumably this doesn't work so go ahead and go implement that form redirect. 
I hope you are starting to see a pattern at this point. Now we can fill out,
submit the form, and verify the redirect. One extra chunk of functionality we 
should test is that the new address we submitted appears in the list of 
addresses on the index. Lets add some logic to our add address test to check
the list of addresses on the index for the address we just created. At this 
point the test_address_add method should look like this...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def test_address_add(self):
  self.driver.find_element_by_id(&quot;address-street&quot;).send_keys(&quot;285 Edgewater Ln&quot;)
  self.driver.find_element_by_id(&quot;address-submit&quot;).click()
  self.assertEqual(&quot;http://localhost:8080/addressbook&quot;, self.driver.current_url)

  addressDivs = self.driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(&quot;div.addresses &gt; div&quot;)
  self.assertIsNotNone(addressDivs)
  foundAddress = False
  for addressDiv in addressDivs:
    if (&quot;285 Edgewater Ln&quot; == addressDiv.text):
      foundAddress = True
  self.assertTrue(foundAddress)
</pre></div>


<p>So this passes but there is something worth noting. See the hard coded address
"285 Edgewater Ln"? Assume during the first run of this test the test passes
and that address is persisted to whatever datastore backs the development 
version of your application. Now at some later point suppose your persistence
logic breaks. The test wont necessarily catch that because when it looks at the
list of addresses it will the entry from a previous run. My preferred way of 
handling this problem is to introduce some random data into the test. Instead
of a simple hard coded value let's append a random value onto it. To avoid
collisions within the random values we'll also use the date time. Now the
method looks as follows...</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def test_address_add(self):
  streetAddress = &quot;285 Edgewater Ln&quot;
  streetAddress = streetAddress + &quot;_&quot; + str(random.randint(1, 99999))
  streetAddress = streetAddress + &quot;_&quot; + str(time.time())
  self.driver.find_element_by_id(&quot;address-street&quot;).send_keys(streetAddress)
  self.driver.find_element_by_id(&quot;address-submit&quot;).click()
  self.assertEqual(&quot;http://localhost:8080/addressbook&quot;, self.driver.current_url)

  addressDivs = self.driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(&quot;div.addresses &gt; div&quot;)
  self.assertIsNotNone(addressDivs)
  foundAddress = False
  for addressDiv in addressDivs:
    if (streetAddress == addressDiv.text):
      foundAddress = True
  self.assertTrue(foundAddress)
</pre></div>
